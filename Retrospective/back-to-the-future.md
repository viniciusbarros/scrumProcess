# Sprint Retrospective (Back to the Future)

## Setup
- (Optional) Get a Back to the Future clock printed;
- Team sits in the same desk;
- Give the team up to 5 minutes to remember and write down the best or worse situation that happened that sprint.

## Action
- Randomly decide who is going to start;
- (Optional) Give the person the printed clock;
- Ask the chosen one to travel back in time and describe the situation;
- Ask the member to travel back to the future;
- If it was a good memory, probably you won't need clarifications (unless the member didn't describe it properly);
- If it was a problem/bad memory, ask the person, now that s/he **can travel in time**, how s/he would fix that problem traveling back?

## Results
Based on the responses, you will have a list of things that (positively or negatively) impacted the most.

- Ensure to highlight the good things, specially those who involves other team members. It will boost the team partnership.
- List the bad things and add it to your personal SM backlog. Those things possibly need to be addressed in a near future.
