# Sprint Retrospective (foreseeing the future)

## How would a perfect sprint be?
Lets think a sprint (1|2|3|4 weeks) in the future and write 1 nice thing that happened which made our sprint perfect.

- Everyone gets a piece of paper and a pen;
- Team have 3~5 minutes to think and write **1 thing**;

## Scrum Team Backlog

Based on that, create the Scrum Team Backlog:

- List and discuss which ones are possible to achieve;
- List which one the team likes the most;
- Save the list in a separated backlog (the **Scrum Team Backlog**);
- One by one, try to improve/remove the identified barriers during sprint;
- Keep the team updated;
